# 3 Potatoes
**Team name**- 3 potatoes

**School name**- Neerja Modi School(NMS)

**Team members**-

- Advait Gupta

- Arrham Jain

- Manan Agarwal

**Model type**- Healthcare

- This project utilises webcams to analyse the position of the patient to check if they will fall of the hospital bed or not(hospital bed not used for current testing) 

- It also uses Machine Learning Tensorflow model to identify X-ray images

- Also, it uses the ML we created for identifying whether the patient has diseases or not.

- Incase of low accuracy , increase the EPOCHS.

- First switch to T4gpu

- For Patient Supervision Code

- The patient is safe from falling as there is a safe distance between the patient and the Edge of the bed.

- The patient is at risk of falling as there is not much distance between the patient and the edge of the bed.

For Pneumonia Detection Code
First run the rest of the code and adjust it according to your prefernce.
This can take 10 - 20 minutes using the current adjustments

Following is the Ui of the Peumonia Detector

Fisrt Enter Patient Name

Enter Image Url And Execute The code

Since the xray of the lung didnt have pneumonia the patient (Manan) is normal.

To change The Image Used , search for a jpg or jpeg image of an xray of the following and enter it in the xray-url textbox
